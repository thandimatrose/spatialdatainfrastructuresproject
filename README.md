## Scenario

There have been complaints about the price of student accommodation. The municipal valuations department felt that this is a great study area to begin beta testing a new Geoportal for later implementation over the whole of Cape Town. As part of the government's problem analysis, this GeoPortal will provide information on the valuations of homes in the study area. This influences sales and rental prices.
